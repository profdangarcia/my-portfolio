  <h3 align="center">Dan Garcia - Porfolio Project Repo</h3>
</p>

This is my porfolio website repository. Its open source ... so fell free to grab some ideas.

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Try it Local

Three simple steps:

1. This project is made with NPM v13.7.0, so it is recommended that you use the Node Version Manager [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), once you did it run:

```bash
nvm use
```

2. Once you are using the same NPM version just run:

```bash
npm i
```

3. And run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


## üî• Created With

- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) - The greatest frontend hype of the moment. NextJS allows SSR, SSG and a lot of other features ready to use! THANKS FOR THAT VERCEL ‚ù§Ô∏è;
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Why not apply the type hability to Javascript;
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - Powerfull tool to write CSS;
- [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/) - Lots of icons to use as components;

## üßÅ Code Style with:
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) - ESLint is a pluggable lint tool for JavaScript and JSX;
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) -
Prettier updates your code automatically to the standards you want every time you save the file;
- [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) -
EditorConfig is a file and collection formatter in the form of a plugin for code / text editors with the aim of maintaining a consistent code standard between different editors, IDE's or environments;
